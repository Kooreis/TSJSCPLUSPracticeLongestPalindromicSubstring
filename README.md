# Question: How do you find the longest palindromic substring in a given string? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string. The main function, `longestPalindromicSubstring`, iterates over each character in the input string. For each character, it calls the helper function `expandAroundCenter` twice, once considering the character as the center of a potential odd-length palindrome, and once considering the character and the next one as the center of a potential even-length palindrome. The `expandAroundCenter` function checks if the characters to the left and right of the center(s) are the same, and if so, expands the potential palindrome and continues checking. It returns the length of the longest palindrome it found. Back in the main function, if the length of the palindrome found is greater than the length of the previously found longest palindrome, it updates the start and end indices of the longest palindrome. Finally, it returns the longest palindromic substring found. The console logs at the end of the code demonstrate the function's usage and output.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. The logic of the solution is identical in both versions. The main difference is that the TypeScript version includes type annotations, which are not present in the JavaScript version.

In the TypeScript version, the function `longestPalindromicSubstring` is explicitly declared to take a string as an argument and return a string. Similarly, the function `expandAroundCenter` is declared to take a string and two numbers as arguments and return a number. These type annotations help to catch potential type errors at compile time, which can make the code more robust and easier to debug.

Another difference is that the TypeScript version includes a check at the beginning of the `longestPalindromicSubstring` function to return an empty string if the input string is less than 1 character long or null. This is an additional error check that is not present in the JavaScript version.

In terms of language features, both versions use standard JavaScript features and do not use any TypeScript-specific features (other than type annotations). Both versions use `let` for variable declaration, `for` loops for iteration, `Math.max` and `Math.floor` for mathematical calculations, and `string.charAt` and `string.substring` for string manipulation.

# C++ Differences

Both the JavaScript and C++ versions solve the problem using the same approach, which is expanding around the center. They both iterate through the string, treating each character as the center of a potential palindrome, and then expand outwards to find the longest palindrome.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used:

1. String Manipulation: In JavaScript, the `substring` method is used to extract the longest palindromic substring, while in C++, the `substr` method is used for the same purpose. 

2. Input/Output: In JavaScript, the function takes a string as an argument and returns the longest palindromic substring. In C++, the program takes user input from the console using `std::cin` and outputs to the console using `std::cout`.

3. Type Checking: JavaScript is dynamically typed, so there's no need to specify the type of variables. In contrast, C++ is statically typed, so the type of each variable must be declared.

4. Function Declaration: In JavaScript, functions are declared using the `function` keyword, while in C++, functions are declared with the return type preceding the function name.

5. String Length: In JavaScript, the length of a string is accessed using the `.length` property, while in C++, the `size()` method is used to get the length of a string.

6. Character Access: In JavaScript, individual characters in a string can be accessed using the `charAt` method, while in C++, characters can be accessed directly using array-like indexing.

7. Main Function: In C++, the `main` function is the entry point of the program, while in JavaScript, there is no such concept. The JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom, and functions are called as needed.
